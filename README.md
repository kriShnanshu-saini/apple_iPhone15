## Introduction

This project was a fantastic learning journey where I explored and implemented animations with GSAP in React and 3D model rendering with Three.js. The website was developed with guidance from the JavaScript Mastery channel on YouTube.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating animations.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for hosting the project.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kriShnanshu-saini/apple_iPhone15.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`. Explore the interactive features and animations that showcase the Apple iPhone 15.

## Challenges Faced

### - Video Carousel

One of the significant challenges I faced was implementing the progress bar for the video carousel. Understanding how it works and making it function correctly was a tough task. However, after some research and experimentation, I was able to grasp the concept and can now build a similar progress bar with some minor adjustments.

### - Model Rendering in React with Lighting Configurations

Rendering the 3D model in React using Three.js and configuring the lighting was another challenging aspect. Positioning the lights correctly to achieve the desired effect required a lot of tweaking and testing. This experience taught me the intricacies of working with 3D models and lighting in a web environment.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible under the guidance of the [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) channel on YouTube. Their tutorials and explanations were invaluable in helping me understand the concepts and techniques used in this project.
